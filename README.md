About Me
######
I am a pragmatic developer specialized in creating Full Stack responsive web applications from scratch.

Currently enrolled in Digital Crafts bootcamp in Atlanta, GA to gather the skills necessary to build and scale responsive web applications. My goal is to be an immediate asset to any SaaS or software company that I apply for. I pay attention to the minutiea and I am always making an effort to be mindful of the skills I haven't fully developed to identify new learning opportunities. Outside of coding, my passions include social justice, bike riding, and music.
